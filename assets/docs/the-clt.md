# The Central Limit Theorem

Suppose you are running an experiment in which the outcomes have an arbitrary probability distribution. This means that the random variable of the experiment is **not** a **Normal** random variable.

It may be a completely uniform distribution, In this example, we use dice for which the probability of each face is randomized.  To reiterate, we can *not* use the Normal Distribution to predict the likely-hood of a single roll of this randomized die.

Simply put, the Central Limit Theorem says; if you run this experiment *N* times, then the ***sum*** of those *N* outcomes will be normally distributed, as long as *N* is large enough.

Test it out by making a very skewed die distribution and setting the number of dice (our *N*) to be small. Press '**Show Sum Distribution**' to see how likely each possible sum is. As you increase *N*, the resulting graph should look more and more *Normal* shaped.
