# Journals from Sweden - Getting Away From Being Pretty Much A Husk Of A Human Being

__Author's Note:__ Footnotes are intended to be read as they are encountered. Author's Notes signify things that were written after the trip and will be denoted with a *.

## June 28, 1:53 pm

Purchased the notebook with the intention to write, hopefully reality reflects intention.

So far my goal for the trip has been realized: I have read each day.

Note: Birds here are very unafraid of people. Just now a finch perched on top of the chair across the table from me, giving the illusion that I am sharing an afternoon beer with this bird.  The un-interrupting nature of Swedes suits me just fine. I feel unnaturally natural sitting alone, here.

## " ~~~ " 2:41 pm

Another several/handful/couple-dozen pages read and DFW$^{[1]}$ is entering my brain and synthesizing quite easily into my person and convictions and writing style$^{[2]}$.  Imitation yadda yadda flattery; though perhaps it's best to stay at arms length, mental health-wise.  

I think it may be time to sit near the water.

Arrived at Near The Water.  At the outskirts of the park that Pip* was telling me about last night. In summary, the park is not$^{[1]}$ pretty but not ugly either. It is open-to-all, truly a "park for the people" in the sense that all types of people are here. Both the un and desirable congregate here in spades.  Just on my immediate entrance I have seen:  

- A police van and the motivating scene for its presence.
- A group of women$^{[2]}$ doing yoga-in-the-park.
- The most beautiful pair of scantily clad$^{[3]}$  women/girls I've yet seen/ogled-from-a-distance.
- An ambulance in the distance for which the cause of is, as yet, unknown to me$^{[4]}$.
- A man foraging for berries from a tree.
- Seagulls.

Jesus H. Fucking Christ the seagulls here are huge and terrifyingly unafraid.  The Swedes are exceptionally good at not-littering, so the seagulls have taken it upon themselves to do it for them. Real job creators, staples of the society, etc. Each evening, the seagulls meticulously empty the contents of every single outdoor garbage receptacle (of which there are many; recall the good-at-not-littering comment) onto the surrounding ground for themselves, but also many of the other local fauna, to participate in the resultant smörgåsbord of delicious trash splayed about in a dissipating circle around the bin, and each morning the mess gets cleaned up by unseen cleaners so that the parks are once again spotless by the time anyone might arrive.  It is unclear if these invisible paragons of anti-litter are thankful or resentful to the seagulls for their Sisyphean task.

## " ~~~ " 3:58 pm

Back at the apartment for a much needed pee$^{[1]}$. I've also developed a general sweaty dampness across All Body. The humidity here is rather low$^{[2]}$ but the thermometer is clocking in at one single hair below 30 °C. Humidity or no, hot-as-balls is, in fact, hot on the balls. A midday lukewarm shower seems in good order.

Unintended long hiatus from Journal is unfortunate but was unavoidable.

Sitting now in the courtyard of the apartment complex.  The most comical cat of all time is sitting ~6 ft away, nearly indescribable. Orange cat of some unknown variety. Under normal circumstances would be extremely bushy and furry but has been given a most unfortunate haircut so that its head and face and paws have retained all their natural full length but the torso has been trimmed to ~1 cm depth, giving the impression of a geriatric man$^{[1]}$ with a face-consuming mustache, wearing Uggs. The tail has also been left *au naturel*.  The result is freakish and wonderful.

I'm sitting in a chair whose seat and backing are of the plastic wicker sort.  The weaving of the seat is not quite taut, or perhaps just overstretched. The consequence is that the wicker portion is sunken below the aluminum frame of the edge, giving the chair a sort of bucket-like form that has a very strict ass-diameter allowance so that even I am somehow overburdened with ass to sit comfortably in.

My attempt to coax the kitty over for a polite petting was successful. Not much else to say, really.  Feeling oddly depressed despite it all.  A baby seagull, just old enough to start looking ugly, is waddling its way up the ramp to the courtyard, signaling a good time to pack up before the overbearing parents start swooping in.  My hipbones are thankful.

Retreated back into the apartment, feeling slightly worse each moment. Already dreading the avalanche of "How was the trip!?"'s:  
"Great$^{[1]}$!",  "Got to see old friends$^{[2]}$!", "Met a whole bunch of cool people$^{[3]}$."  

Seems pretty clear that the requirement to teach this evening is causing this snap-back-to-reality, we're-not-in-Kansas-anymore, vacation's-over-pal style of Depression (TM).  Not to mention I have this acute feeling that I've overstayed my welcome some. This isn't actually my fault.  My generous host is undergoing some relationship woes that have made the living arrangements somewhat awkward. I am getting the distinct, but extremely well-hidden, impression that I am "stepping on toes" and I can't shake the feeling that I may be unintentionally contributing to an un-mendable tear.*

I certainly don't want to be back home, but I think I don't really want to be here anymore either. Work sucks, I know.

## July 4, 11:04 am

I made it to "My" cafe$^{[1]}$  in time for the breakfast menu today: 79 kr for a coffee$^{[2]}$ and a very nice ham & cheese sandwich. I've had it nearly every day.  After 11 they stop serving the breakfast at this price, I found out the hard way.

I sit at the tables on the sidewalk outside the cafe and read while passersby, both pedestrian and vehicular, give me a not-quite polite look. Something between a glance, a side-eye, and a stare.  If I look up to meet the gaze$^{[3]}$ they look away quickly, somewhat abashedly.

The look comes from the fact that, as an unspoken rule, Swedes do not dress in colour. Every single person here$^{[4]}$ dresses exclusively in white, black, and beige$^{[5]}$.  Splashes of dreary colour are permitted as accent pieces of an article or as part of an otherwise grey-scale pattern, and you may wear a jacket that is a solid colour as long as the rest of your outfit fits the W.B.B. mold.  Business Casual Blue is allowed.  T-shirts of a fixed colour are sanctioned only if they use black/grey pronouns.

I, on the other hand, have been wearing a flamboyantly coloured jacket. It has various shades of cyans, yellows, pinks, purples, and oranges in striped and woven patterns, and today have also donned a deep mustard yellow long-sleeved shirt-hoodie thing below the jacket$^{[6]}$. Personally, I think I pull it off quite well; i.e. I looking fucking great in this shit.

It is wholly impossible to tell if people are staring in awe at the sight of such a coloured person$^{[7]}$ or are offended at being confronted, without consent, to the hideousness of it all.  The incredulous looks are age independent as well, although the quality of the look may have *some* demographic differences.  Surprisingly, the older folks have a far less judgmental valence in their eyes, but the staring is overt. It's mostly a look of eye-popping surprise, like a pink rabbit has been pulled out of a visibly gay hat right in front of them.

Young people are much more discrete, never turning their heads to look, but their eyes are glued to me as they walk past; like those paintings that seem to always be staring at you no matter where in the gallery you happen to be standing, except instead of the viewer moving about and the eyes following it's the paintings themselves that are moving while maintaining eye-contact. As if the gallery were a long hallway with the paintings hung on a clothesline style pulley system and instead of walking down the hallway, patrons stand in place while the paintings view *them*$^{[8]}$ as they pass by.  The side-eye stare from the youngsters is definitely judgmental.  There is a look of disgust in their faces, and I even caught a proper scoff once.

As I am writing this, I've just turned around$^{[9]}$ and I now realize that I have been sat in front of the windowed-displaying menu, and may have been reading slightly too deeply into (some of) these looks...

> $^{[1]}$ I have come here nearly every morning for breakfast and to read. I don't recall the name$^{[a]}$. It is very a Swedish name in the sense that the word looks very much like a word in the Swedish language.

## " ~~~ " 3:20 pm

Sitting on the patio of a restaurant for lunch next to an obviously American elderly tourist who did not get the memo that it is unimaginably rude to listen to your political podcasts out-loud at full volume on your phones tinny and horrible speakers as you eat lunch as slowly as humanly-fucking-possible so as to maximize the annoyance you inflict on to your neighbouring luncheon-ers. By the way, this may be the most expensive lunch$^{[1]}$ of my life in a tiny and quaint Swedish meatball joint.  There are exactly one (1) tables inside the place and four outside on the terrace: I and she$^{[2]}$ are sitting outside.

American-ness has been confirmed: she answered a phone-call from her husband; accent unmistakable. Some minutes pass and he has now joined her$^{[3]}$.

Post-Eating update:

After eavesdropping their entire conversation$^{[1]}$ I have learned that the husband has some kind of debilitating disease.  He looks very much like what you hope your therapist looks like.  He wears small, round glasses in front of soft eyes that understand suffering$^{[2]}$ from what you can only assume is Personal Experience.  He talks softly and since he can also speak swedish, I presume he is the catalyst for their presence here in Stockholm.  BTW, I know he can speak swedish because he made a phone-call to the super of the building they are staying in. Apparently he got trapped in the buildings' elevator and had to bang on the doors for someone to get him out.  The phone conversation was in Swedish, but he explained the story to his wife in English.

His unknown disease is preventing him from involvement in various familial activities that were planned for their trip and she is attempting to Figure Out workarounds, though it sounds more like she is brokering some type of high-stakes business deal.

## July 6, 11:48 am

Arrived in the airport in MTL for a 4-ish hour layover.  Now sitting in one of the airport restaurants. Desperately missing the greatest gift that being in a foreign country in which the dominant language is not English provides - Not being inundated with the vacuous, banal, and horridly vapid conversations of those around you. Now, the conversations of others are not simply background noise, but auditory assaults.  

I am extremely upset about how much I know about the relationship$^{[1]}$ status' of people named Greg, Dan, Nicole, Lisa, and the as yet nameless narrator$^{[2]}$. Apparently, Nicole "like" met Dan at "like" his best, but "like" Dan then "like" totally fucked up by "like" totally hitting on Lisa and "like" I [sic. AYNN] was "like" w.t.f. because "like" Greg and Lisa have "like" been a Thing for "like" three solid weeks now, and "like" Dan ob-viously knew that, and ... etc.

I may be posted up here a while so I'll do my best to describe the scenery/decor-that-is-meant-to-be-"scenery" of the restaurant.  I can really only describe it as: embarrassingly Canadian.  It really is embarrassing. The lighting is provided by large hanging ring lights that are ~1 m tall and ~3 m in diameter and the black metal frames of the rings are enveloped with red and black *plaid flannel*... like I said, embarrassing. On the walls, hanging in totally symmetric rows and columns$^{[3]}$ are still photos of all the typical Canadian wildlife, complete with nine photos of Moose$^{[4]}$, one of a red fox$^{[5]}$, a photo of a pair of blackbears$^{[6]}$, one of some Loons on a lake, and another of an owl in flight and below that a photo of a family of Puffins.  Of course, it goes almost without saying, that the walls are all wood$^{[7]}$ panelling$^{[8]}$ and the load-bearing pillars$^{[9]}$ are clearly meant to look like real, whole logs but are obviously not.  The pièce de résistance$^{[10]}$ is all the life-sized$^{[11]}$ stuffed moose heads attached to various wall sections.  There are two in direct view of my vantage point and I'm apprehensive to look around the place for fear of finding more.  It's pathetic, like, can we just pretend to take ourselves the tiniest bit seriously? Just for the sake of first impressions, at least.

Slightly drunk now, waiting to board. Not mentioning the incumbent cost.
