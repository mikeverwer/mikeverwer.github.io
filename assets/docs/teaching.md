## Courses I've Taught

### MATH10042 - Math for Computer Studies | [School Link](https://cereg.mohawkcollege.ca/course?courseCode=MATH10042)

<details><summary><b>Click to see course description</b></summary>
In this course we focus on the fundamentals of digital logic. We begin with the concept of positional numbering systems; including decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.  It is important to begin here because the binary based number systems are the basis of all computer architecture and logic.  From there we discuss arithmetic in the binary system and introduce Boolean algebra.  
Boolean algebra is the logic system that computers use at the mechanical level of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate#Manufacturing" target="_blank">gate</a>.  It is also how circuits are designed.  We showcase this by designing the circuit for a 7-segment display (think of the digits on a digital clock, or a basic calculator).  We also explore an application of binary strings through the example of Unicode UTF-8 code-point encodings.  
We finish the course with standard lessons on algebra, linear functions, and exponential and logarithmic functions.

### MATH10064 - Discrete Math & Statistics | [School Link](https://cereg.mohawkcollege.ca/course?courseCode=MATH10064)

<details><summary><b>Click to see course description</b></summary>
Within this curriculum, we discuss various introductory topics in the realm of discrete mathematics.  Discreteness means that things are fully separated from each other; you could also say that the members of a discrete set are listable, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set" target="_blank">countable</a>.  
The typical example of a discrete set is the set of Integers.  In fact all discrete sets can be reduced to some subset of the integers. For this reason, studying the integers is of huge importance in discrete math and, to that end, the course begins with some introductory number theory. We start with the primary building blocks of the integers, prime numbers. We discuss testing for primality and then expand our notion of "division" in the integers with modular arithmetic.  
After this we shift our focus to counting and probabilities, and then finish the course with an exploration of introductory statistics.

### MATH10088 - Technical Math 1 | [School Link](https://cereg.mohawkcollege.ca/course?courseCode=MATH10088)

<details><summary><b>Click to see course description</b></summary>
This is the first math course for various engineering programs; including civil and mechanical engineering,
architectural technology, and others.
<br>
The content focuses on core math skills for problem solving and analytical thinking. It begins with a review of algebra,
calculation methods, and unit conversion. Afterwards, we move into problem solving techniques involving algebra and
linear equations, then moving into a study of angles, and triangle trigonometry, and ending with systems of linear
equations.

### XMTH10001 - Math for Analytics (Calculus) | [School Link](https://myssb.mohawkcollege.ca/mcprod/psecrsdes.P_CrseGet_PS?subj_code=XMTH&crse_numb=10001&term_code=202330&prg=392&vrs=23-A)

<details><summary><b>Click to see course description</b></summary>
This course is part of the newly offered <a href="https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/programs/business/bachelor-of-analytics-and-data-management-honours-392" target="_blank">Bachelor of Analytics and Data Management</a> program at Mohawk, in which students earn a full Bachelors degree in the field of data analytics with a focus on business decision making. The program is offered through the Business department.
<br>
The content of the course revolves around differential and integral calculus with a strong focus on business related applications. We begin by understanding algebraic and transcendental functions, like polynomials, rational functions, exponential/logarithmic functions, etc. before diving into differentiation and then integration.

### CALC10000 & MECH10051 - Trade Calculations | [School Link](https://cereg.mohawkcollege.ca/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=1012645&selectedProgramAreaId=1009675&selectedProgramStreamId=1009723)

<details><summary><b>Click to see course description</b></summary>
CALC10000 and MECH10051 are both offered at the Mohawk College Trade School located at the Stoney Creek campus. The courses contain the same material but are specified for different skilled trade programs.
<br>
The courses go over foundational concepts in math like arithmetic, fractions, decimals, and proportions & percentages.
</details>

### MATH10083 (MA101) - Basic Business Math [School Link](https://myssb.mohawkcollege.ca/mcprod/psecrsdes.P_CrseGet_PS?subj_code=MATH&crse_numb=10083&term_code=202130&prg=320&vrs=24-A)

<details><summary><b>Click to see course description</b></summary>
This course begins with foundational math concepts in numeracy and algebraic skills like the order of operations, exponents, and algebraic manipulation of equations. After this, we move into business related topics of trade & cash discounts, invoicing, markup & markdown, and break-even analysis.
