# Hi, I'm Mike

I'm a professor of Mathematics and Statistics, currently at Mohawk College.  I have a specialty in abstract algebra and universal algebra, but my primary mathematical interests lie in computation theory and the philosophy of mathematics. I completed my masters degree at McMaster University in 2019, working under Dr. Matt Valeriote.  You can find a link to my thesis in the right sidebar.

Outside of mathematics, I like to collect books and records. In my spare time, I work on various programming projects and I have fun making digital art and graphic design.  I also write things from time to time.  Take a look at [Programs](/programs/programs_home.html) to see some of the things I've made. You can also check out my github via the left sidebar.

If you are a student at Mohawk, stop by my office in E208.
