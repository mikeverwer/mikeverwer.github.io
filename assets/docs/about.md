# Hi, I'm Mike

From 2019 until 2024 I was a professor of Mathematics and Statistics at the college level.  I have a specialty in abstract algebra and universal algebra, but my primary mathematical interests lie in computation theory and the philosophy of mathematics. I completed my masters degree at McMaster University in 2019, working under Dr. Matt Valeriote.  You can find a link to my thesis in the right sidebar.

Currently, I am pursuing a post-graduate diploma in data analytics from Douglas College. I am very excited about the opportunity to learn many new skills in data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and software development. As I work to transition into the world of industry, my goal is to apply my extensive mathematical background to solve real-world problems. My experience in abstract algebra and computation theory give me a unique perspective on the challenges of data science and analysis that I hope to leverage into the field.

I am available for private tutoring and would love to help students enhance their understanding of mathematics and programming. With my background in mathematics, I can assist with a range of topics, from foundational concepts to more advanced subjects all throughout the the high school and college levels. Additionally, I have a strong proficiency in Python and can guide students through everything from basic programming principles to more complex projects. Feel free to reach out at my email below if you would like to schedule a session.

Outside of mathematics, I like to collect books and records. In my spare time, I work on various programming projects and I have fun making digital art and graphic design.  I also write things from time to time.  Take a look at [Programs](/programs.html) to see some of the things I've made. You can also check out my github via the left sidebar.
