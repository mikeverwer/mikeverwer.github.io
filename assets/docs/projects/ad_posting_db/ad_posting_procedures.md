# List of Stored Procedures For the College Ad Posting Database

This document contains the full list of all stored procedures used in the college ad posting database described [here](mikeverwer.github.io/projects/ad_posting_db.html). The list is separated into categories based on their relevant domain area. Each procedure is listed by its name and includes a description of function and a signature that is engine-agnostic. Note that `string(n)` is used in place of datatypes like `CHAR(n)`, `VARCHAR(n)`, or `TEXT`.

## Person & Roles

Registering people and managing the roles they hold. Registration is layered: AddNonMember inserts a bare Person, AddCollegeMember wraps it, and AddStudent / AddEmployee wrap that in turn. The Grant/Revoke pairs move an existing person between roles without re-registering them. Also holds the core-info editors, the reviewer-flag setter, and the two contact-lookup procedures.

AddNonMember
: Add a person with no college affiliation. Inserts into Person only. Use for members of the public who post ads. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):  
  ```
  AddNonMember(  
    IN  FirstName : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]  
    IN  LastName  : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]  
    IN  Phone     : string(10)   = null [optional]  
    IN  Email     : string(50)   [required, not null/empty; unique]  
    OUT PersonID  : integer      [assigned to the new Person row id]  
  )
  ```

AddCollegeMember
: Add a college member who is neither a student nor an employee. Intended for people who retain a college ID and board privileges without being enrolled or employed; alumni are the motivating case. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  AddCollegeMember(
    IN  FirstName  : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]
    IN  LastName   : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]
    IN  Phone      : string(10)   = null [optional]
    IN  Email      : string(50)   [required, not null/empty; unique]
    IN  CollegeID  : string(9)    [required, not null/empty; unique]
    IN  Department : string(50)   = null [optional]
    OUT PersonID   : integer      [assigned to the new Person row id]
  )
  ```

AddStudent
: Add a student. Inserts Person, CollegeMember, and Student. Department (the student's academic department) and Major are both supplied by the caller; they are related but distinct, and Major may be NULL for a student who has not declared one. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  AddStudent(
    IN  FirstName  : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]
    IN  LastName   : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]
    IN  Phone      : string(10)   = null [optional]
    IN  Email      : string(50)   [required, not null/empty; unique]
    IN  CollegeID  : string(9)    [required, not null/empty; unique]
    IN  Department : string(50)   = null [optional]
    IN  Major      : string(60)   = null [optional]
    OUT PersonID   : integer      [assigned to the new Person row id]
  )
  ```

AddEmployee
: Add an employee. Inserts Person, CollegeMember, and Employee. Extension requires OfficeLocation. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  AddEmployee(
    IN  FirstName      : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]
    IN  LastName       : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]
    IN  Phone          : string(10)   = null [optional]
    IN  Email          : string(50)   [required, not null/empty; unique]
    IN  CollegeID      : string(9)    [required, not null/empty; unique]
    IN  Department     : string(50)   = null [optional]
    IN  OfficeLocation : string(15)   = null [optional]
    IN  Extension      : string(6)    = null [optional; requires OfficeLocation]
    IN  PositionTitle  : string(20)   [required; must be one of: Faculty, Administration, Staff, Support, Specialized]
    IN  IsReviewer     : boolean      = false [optional]
    OUT PersonID       : integer      [assigned to the new Person row id]
  )
  ```

GrantCollegeMemberRole
: Grant a person College Member status (Person -> CollegeMember). Requires the person already exist in Person and not already be a College Member. Use for someone gaining a College ID without yet being a Student or Employee.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GrantCollegeMemberRole(
    IN  PersonID   : integer      [required]
    IN  CollegeID  : string(9)    [required, not null/empty; unique]
    IN  Department : string(50)   = null [optional]
  )
  ```

RevokeCollegeMemberRole
: Revoke College Member status (deletes the CollegeMember row). Refuses if the person still holds Student or Employee status, since both are structurally dependent on CollegeMember. Revoke those first.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  RevokeCollegeMemberRole(
    IN  PersonID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

GrantStudentRole
: Grant a person Student status (CollegeMember -> Student). Requires the person already hold College Member status. Does not check Employee status either way, so this is also how a person who already holds Employee status becomes a dual Student/Employee.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GrantStudentRole(
    IN  PersonID : integer      [required]
    IN  Major    : string(60)   = null [optional]
  )
  ```

RevokeStudentRole
: Revoke Student status (deletes the Student row only; College Member and, if held, Employee status are untouched).
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  RevokeStudentRole(
    IN  PersonID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

GrantEmployeeRole
: Grant a person Employee status (CollegeMember -> Employee). Requires the person already hold College Member status. Does not check Student status either way, so this is also how an existing Student becomes a dual Student/Employee. Not to be confused with SetReviewerPermission, which only flips the IsReviewer flag on an Employee row that already exists.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GrantEmployeeRole(
    IN  PersonID       : integer      [required]
    IN  OfficeLocation : string(15)   = null [optional]
    IN  Extension      : string(6)    = null [optional; requires OfficeLocation]
    IN  PositionTitle  : string(20)   [required; must be one of: Faculty, Administration, Staff, Support, Specialized]
    IN  IsReviewer     : boolean      = false [optional]
  )
  ```

RevokeEmployeeRole
: Revoke Employee status. Any ad this person has reviewed has its ReviewerID explicitly cleared first, then the Employee row is deleted. College Member and, if held, Student status are untouched. Not to be confused with SetReviewerPermission, which only flips the IsReviewer flag; this removes the Employee row entirely.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  RevokeEmployeeRole(
    IN  PersonID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

EditUserCoreInfo
: Edit a person's core contact info (FirstName, LastName, Phone, Email). Does not touch role-specific fields (Department, Major, OfficeLocation, Extension, PositionTitle); those belong to CollegeMember/Student/Employee and have no editor here.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  EditUserCoreInfo(
    IN  PersonID  : integer      [required]
    IN  FirstName : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]
    IN  LastName  : string(50)   [required, not null/empty]
    IN  Phone     : string(10)   = null [optional]
    IN  Email     : string(50)   [required, not null/empty; unique]
  )
  ```

EditCollegeMemberInfo
: Edit a College Member's CollegeID and/or Department. Does not create College Member status; see GrantCollegeMemberRole/AddCollegeMember for that. PersonID must already hold the role.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  EditCollegeMemberInfo(
    IN  PersonID   : integer      [required]
    IN  CollegeID  : string(9)    [required, not null/empty; unique]
    IN  Department : string(50)   = null [optional]
  )
  ```

EditStudentInfo
: Edit a Student's Major. PersonID must already hold Student status; see GrantStudentRole/AddStudent for that.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  EditStudentInfo(
    IN  PersonID : integer      [required]
    IN  Major    : string(60)   = null [optional]
  )
  ```

EditEmployeeInfo
: Edit an Employee's OfficeLocation, Extension, and PositionTitle. Does not touch IsReviewer; see SetReviewerPermission for that, kept separate so the reviewer flag has exactly one setter. PersonID must already hold Employee status; see GrantEmployeeRole/AddEmployee.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  EditEmployeeInfo(
    IN  PersonID       : integer      [required]
    IN  OfficeLocation : string(15)   = null [optional]
    IN  Extension      : string(6)    = null [optional; requires OfficeLocation]
    IN  PositionTitle  : string(20)   [required; must be one of: Faculty, Administration, Staff, Support, Specialized]
  )
  ```

SetReviewerPermission
: Set IsReviewer role for an employee. Only flips the flag on an existing Employee row; see GrantEmployeeRole to create that row in the first place.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  SetReviewerPermission(
    IN  EmpID : integer   [required; must be an employee]
    IN  IsRev : boolean   [required]
  )
  ```

GetPosterInfo
: Show Contact information of the poster of a given ad.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GetPosterInfo(
    IN  AdID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

GetReviewerInfo
: Show Contact information of the reviewer of a given ad.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GetReviewerInfo(
    IN  AdID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

## Ad Lifecycle & Review
Moving an ad through its states: submission, the review decision, and poster-initiated withdrawal. Also holds the full-detail ad lookup and the two rejection-history reports, which read the outcome of that review process.

SubmitAd
: Submit a new ad for review. Inserts a new Ad row with ReviewStatus = 'Pending', ReviewerID = NULL, PostDate = NULL, EnteredPending = today, and ReviewDate = NULL. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  SubmitAd(
    IN  PosterID      : integer      [required]
    IN  Title         : string(128)  [required, not null/empty]
    IN  AdType        : string(20)   [required; must be one of: Tutorship, Rent, Sale, Roommate, Event, Service, Other]
    IN  AdLength      : integer      [required; > 0]
    IN  AdWidth       : integer      [required; > 0]
    IN  Duration      : integer      = 14 [optional; > 0]
    IN  ImageFileName : string(255)  [required, not null/empty]
    OUT AdID          : integer      [assigned to the new Ad row id]
  )
  ```

GetAdDetails
: Full detail view for any ad(s) by AdID, not just those pending review. Pass a comma-separated list of AdIDs, or NULL for every ad. Board location is intentionally omitted; pair with GetAdPostings for that, since joining Ad_Posted_Board here would multiply rows for any ad posted to more than one board.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GetAdDetails(
    IN  AdIDList : string(max)   = null [optional; comma separated string of integers]
  )
  ```

ReviewAd
: Approve or Reject an ad. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  ReviewAd(
    IN  AdID       : integer      [required]
    IN  Status     : string(10)   [required; must be one of: Approved, Rejected, Pending]
    IN  ReviewerID : integer      [required; must be an employee with IsReviewer = 1]
    IN  ReviewDate : date         = null [optional; defaults to today]
  )
  ```

WithdrawAd
: Withdraw an ad. Poster-initiated; sets IsWithdrawn/WithdrawnDate and purges every message on the ad, but does NOT touch ReviewStatus and does NOT remove the ad from any board it is currently posted to. Withdrawal is one-way. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  WithdrawAd(
    IN  AdID                : integer   [required]
    IN  PosterID            : integer   [required; must be the ad's poster]
    OUT DeletedMessageCount : integer   [number of messages deleted]
  )
  ```

DeleteAd
: Permanently delete an ad. Admin-initiated, and distinct from WithdrawAd. Refuses while the ad is still posted to any board. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  DeleteAd(
    IN  AdID                : integer      [required]
    IN  ReviewerID          : integer      [required; must be an employee with IsReviewer = 1]
    OUT DeletedMessageCount : integer      [number of messages deleted]
    OUT ImageFileName       : string(255)  [image file name for cleanup]
  )
  ```

GetNoncompliantPosters
: Procedure to find people who have posted multiple rejected ads.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GetNoncompliantPosters(
    IN  MinRejections : integer = 2 [optional]
  )
  ```

GetPosterRejectionHistory
: Procedure to find the rejection history of a user (poster).
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GetPosterRejectionHistory(
    IN  PosterID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

## Board & Posting
Creating and retiring the physical boards, editing a board's dimensions/location, placing approved ads onto them, removing them again, and the two read-only helpers for checking fit and looking up where an ad currently hangs.

NewBoard
: Add a new board. The only real constraint is that the location (Building, BldgFloor, Slot) not already be in use.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  NewBoard(
    IN  Building    : string(4)   [required]
    IN  BldgFloor   : integer     [required]
    IN  Slot        : string(1)   [required]
    IN  BoardLength : integer     [required; > 0]
    IN  BoardWidth  : integer     [required; > 0]
  )
  ```

RetireBoard
: Retire (permanently remove) a board. Refuses if any ad is currently posted there. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  RetireBoard(
    IN  Building  : string(4)   [required]
    IN  BldgFloor : integer     [required]
    IN  Slot      : string(1)   [required]
  )
  ```

EditBoardDetails
: Edit a board's dimensions and/or location. Refuses to shrink below the area currently occupied by posted ads; unpost some first, or choose a larger size. Location changes rely on fk_adpostedboard_board's ON UPDATE CASCADE: changing Board's key here automatically updates every matching Ad_Posted_Board row to follow, so posted ads move with the board instead of requiring the unpost/new-board/repost workaround. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  EditBoardDetails(
    IN  Building       : string(4)   [required]
    IN  BldgFloor      : integer     [required]
    IN  Slot           : string(1)   [required]
    IN  NewBuilding    : string(4)   [required]
    IN  NewBldgFloor   : integer     [required]
    IN  NewSlot        : string(1)   [required]
    IN  NewBoardLength : integer     [required; > 0]
    IN  NewBoardWidth  : integer     [required; > 0]
  )
  ```

PostAd
: Create a procedure to post an ad to a given board. Assumes that the user has confirmed that the ad will fit on the board separately. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  PostAd(
    IN  AdID  : integer      [required; must be approved and not expired/withdrawn]
    IN  Bldg  : string(4)    [required]
    IN  Floor : integer      [required]
    IN  Slot  : string(1)    [required]
  )
  ```

UnpostAd
: Remove an unapproved ad from the Ad_Posted_Board table. If a specific board is given, it will only remove the ad from that board, otherwise it will remove it from all boards it is currently on.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  UnpostAd(
    IN  AdID      : integer      [required]
    IN  Building  : string(4)    = null [optional; required with BldgFloor and Slot]
    IN  BldgFloor : integer      = null [optional; required with Building and Slot]
    IN  Slot      : string(1)    = null [optional; required with Building and BldgFloor]
  )
  ```

CheckAdFit
: Procedure to evaluate if a given ad will fit on each board.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  CheckAdFit(
    IN  AdID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

GetAdPostings
: Procedure to find all the information and locations of a posted ad.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GetAdPostings(
    IN  AdID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

## Messaging
Sending, retrieving, and deleting the messages exchanged about an ad. DeleteAdMessages is also the mechanism WithdrawAd uses to clear fk_messages_ad before flagging an ad as withdrawn.

SendMessage
: Send a message about an ad. The ad's PosterID must be either the sender or the recipient. Messaging is only allowed on an Approved ad, UNLESS the sender or recipient is a reviewer (Employee.IsReviewer = 1). Self-messaging is intentionally allowed. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  SendMessage(
    IN  SenderID    : integer      [required]
    IN  AdID        : integer      [required]
    IN  RecipientID : integer      [required]
    IN  Content     : string(max)  [required, not null/empty]
  )
  ```

GetAllADMessages
: Retrieve all messages about a given ad, showing sender and recipient names, message content, and timestamp.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  GetAllADMessages(
    IN  AdID : integer   [required]
  )
  ```

DeleteMessage
: Delete a single message, identified by its full primary key (SenderID, AdID, TimeLogged). This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  DeleteMessage(
    IN  SenderID   : integer   [required]
    IN  AdID       : integer   [required]
    IN  TimeLogged : datetime  [required]
  )
  ```

DeleteAdMessages
: Delete every message attached to a given ad. This is the mechanism WithdrawAd will use to clear fk_messages_ad before deleting the Ad row itself. This procedure must be called inside a transaction the CALLER controls.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  DeleteAdMessages(
    IN  AdID         : integer   [required]
    OUT DeletedCount : integer   [number of messages deleted]
  )
  ```

## Lookups & Search
Read-only search helpers for finding records by more human-friendly criteria than raw primary keys: poster name, ad title, person name, and message participant name. Every name match here accepts a first name, a last name, or the full "First Last" string; title search is the only partial match, since ad titles are free text.

SearchAdsByPosterName
: Find ads by the poster's name (first, last, or full "First Last", exact). Returns enough to identify a result and hand its AdID or PosterID to another procedure; GetAdDetails, GetPosterInfo, etc.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  SearchAdsByPosterName(
    IN  PosterName : string(101)   [required]
  )
  ```

SearchAdsByTitle
: Find ads whose title contains the given text (case-sensitivity follows the database's default collation). Unlike every other search here, this is a partial match, since ad titles are free text; known simplification: a search term containing a literal % or _ will be interpreted as a wildcard rather than a literal character.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  SearchAdsByTitle(
    IN  TitleSearch : string(128)   [required]
  )
  ```

SearchPeopleByName
: Find people by name (first, last, or full "First Last", exact), with a breakdown of which roles each result currently holds.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  SearchPeopleByName(
    IN  Name : string(101)   [required]
  )
  ```

SearchMessagesBySenderOrRecipientName
: Find messages between the calling person and anyone matching the given name, restricted to conversations the searcher actually took part in. SearcherID must be either the sender or the recipient of any row returned; this is a lookup over a person's own messages, not a general message browser.
: Signature (engine-agnostic):
  ```
  SearchMessagesBySenderOrRecipientName(
    IN  SearcherID : integer      [required]
    IN  Name       : string(101)  [required]
  )
  ```
