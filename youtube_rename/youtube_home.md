# Sorry

Unfortunately, I can't have my YouTube videos listed publicly. If you are one of my current students and want to request a link to a video, or submit a video topic request, [send an email](mailto:mike.verwer@mohawkcollege.ca) to my school email:  

> mike.verwer[at]mohawkcollege.ca

with the subject:

> Video Request:

Describe the subject matter that you would like a video on in the body.

Normally, videos will be posted directly to the course Canvas page when the relevant material comes up, so check there first.

Please understand that I may not have a video on what you request and I may choose not make a video on the topic you submit, but I am happy to hear your requests.
