# Projects

I've developed a few small Python tools that help me demonstrate various mathematical concepts in my lectures.  You can check my GitHub via the left sidebar to see all of my public repositories or submit a pull request.

On the right sidebar you can find information and links to any documentation for the projects listed.

Some of the applications are made with PySimpleGUI, which is a proprietary software.  The licensing allows for hobbyist development, but there are some restrictions on the distribution of software made with this library.  If you would like to use them in your classroom, [send me an email](mailto:mike.verwer@gmail.com) at

> `mike.verwer@gmail.com`

and I can help you with installation.
